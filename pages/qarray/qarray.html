            A macro-based, ANSI C compliant dynamic array implementation. This array implementation</br>
            is designed to be:</br>

            <ul>
                <li>Easy to use</li>
                <li>Allow for both stack and heap operations</li>
                <li>Typesafe</li>
            </ul>

            This library is quite simple to integrate into existing C projects. All the programemr</br>
            must do is include the header, define their types, and they can begin using the array.</br>
            This implementation also comes with all the expected operations that are implemented in</br>
            traditional arrays. A complete list can be found below.

            <h3>Operations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Appending</li>
                <li>Insertion</li>
                <li>Popping</li>
                <li>Removing</li>
                <li>Searching</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Important Notes</h3>
            A tactic this implementation takes to operations is the settings macro defined for</br>
            each array. Each array type has a programmer-defined macro that carries settings, which</br>
            are passed as arguments to each macro. This is so it does not get too cumbersome for the</br>
            programmer.</br>
            </br>
            In order to use this, you will need to include the following headers:

            <ul>
                <li>string.h</li>
                <li>stdlib.h</li>
            </ul>

            </br>
            Due to how macro arguments work, all array operations are actually wrappers around the</br>
            macro with the same name, but prefixed with double underscores. The programmer should not</br>
            make use of <b>any</b> macros prefixed with a double underscore.

            <h3>Configuration</h3>
            This array implementation defines the following compile-time options, which should be defined</br>
            before the header is included. If it is not defined, a default will be provided.

            <h5>QARRAY_STACKFUL</h5>
            If this macro is defined, the array operations will behave in a stackful manner. Nothing will</br>
            be done that involves heap memory.</br>

            <h5>QARRAY_RESIZE</h5>
            If this macro is defined, the array will invoke this macro function to calculate the next size</br>
            of the array during a resize operation. If the array is stackful, this is not necessary.</br>
            An example (which is also the default) would be:
            <pre>
            <code>
    #define QARRAY_RESIZE(current_size) \
        current_size + 5
            </code>
            </pre>

            <h5>QARRAY_INITIAL_SIZE</h5>
            If this macro is defined, it will be used as the initial size of a heap-allocated array. If</br>
            the array is stackful, this is not necessary. If it is not defined, it defaults to 5.</br>
