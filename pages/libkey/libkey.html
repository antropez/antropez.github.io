            <h3>libkey</h3>            

            A C library developed for platforms that support the ncurses terminal handling library.</br>
            Its purpose is to make handling the keyboard inside of a terminal easier by giving the</br>
            programmer the tools needed to emulate the modal behavior of editors like Vi and Vim.</br>
            </br>
            The library has interfaces for creating modes, and attaching sequences of keys that can</br>
            execute callbacks upon their completion to the modes. Key sequences can be prefixed with</br>
            a number to tell the callback how many times to execute. Callbacks can also accept an</br>
            arbitrary number of 'argument' keys, which allows the programmer to simulate behavior</br>
            similar to the motions, marking, and register features found in Vi and Vim.</br>
            </br>
            The project follows a couple main design principles.</br>
            <ul>
                <li>Portability (100% ANSI C compliance)</li>
                <li>Being tested to hell and back</li>
                <li>Being stackful (no calls to malloc and friends)</li>
                <li>Be designed around single-threaded applications</li>
            </ul>
