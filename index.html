        Some various things. Some that I like, some that I have made, and some other things.</br>
        </br>
        All projects uploaded are shipped as tarballs using gzip, and separated into versions.</br>
        Versions are separated into their own folder on the server, and is maintained by a</br>
        collection of shell scripts.</br>
        </br>
        Some projects are separated into 'dev' and 'user' branches. Dev, or 'development' branches,</br>
        are intended to be used by programmers developing the project. These will often include</br>
        code that is deemed <b>non-portable</b>, like m4 macros. All development branches will come</br>
        with a Makefile target which will transform the development branch into a 'user' branch.</br>
        User branches have code that is deemed <b>portable</b>, and is shipped alongside development</br>
        branches. They are stored in the same project archive directory, but displayed separately.</br>
        It is worth noting that <b>user projects</b> might not be readable, as they have been</br>
        transformed simply to be executable on a wide variety of machines.</br>
