    <title>M4 Shenanigans</title>

        <p>
        M4 is awesome. It is definitely in my top 10 favorite programming tools. Because of its usefulness,</br>
        or at least, what I perceive to be useful, I use it in all sorts of situations. Writing C code, and</br>
        handling Makefiles are probably my top uses for it. This page simply contains some of the things I</br>
        have written to make integration with M4 easier.</br>
        </p>

        <h2>m4make</h2>
        A Bash script to process a Makefile with M4 into a temporary file before invoking it with Make.</br>
        The dummy Makefile is deleted after Make has executed it. Any arguments passed to m4make are</br>
        directly passed to the Make command itself, and like Make, there is no need to directly specify</br>
        the Makefile. It just has to exist in the directory m4make is invoked in.
        It can be found <a href="m4/m4make.sh">here</a>.</br>
